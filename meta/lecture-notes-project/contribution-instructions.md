Once you have sent the pull request, you can begin taking notes. Your notes should follow [this format](./lecture-note-template.md). We not looking for word for word dictation, but rather what topics, examples and ideas are covered in the lecture. [Follow the sample](./sample-lecture-notes.md) and you should be good.
