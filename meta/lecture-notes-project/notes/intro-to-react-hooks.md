# Intro to React Hooks ðŸŽ£

[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are an addition to the React library (as of version 16.8) which provide state-management for functional components.

## Learning Objectives

- "useState" concepts and an example
- "useEffect" concepts and an example
- Full class-based component converted to a functional component using hooks

## Recommended Previous Knowledge

- Functional React components

## Notes

### Brief refresher of React class-based and functional components

Previously, component state was only available in class-based React components. You may recall manipulating the `state` field of a class-based component via the `setState` function, such as the trivial example below:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Counter extends Component {
  state = {
    count: 0,
  };

  incrementCount = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count} <button onClick={this.incrementCount} /></p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

While they are still a reliable method for composing React code, class-based components were criticized for a multitude of reasons: daunting complexity of learning the React component lifecycle, Javascript classes being difficult to understand, less-than-ideal performace, lots of boilerplate.

To simplify the requirements of components intended to be purely presentational (i.e. containing no state), "functional" components were added to the React api. Functional components removed some of the complexity of working with React component lifecycle methods, and allowed presentational code to be written in a more declarative, and less error-prone manner. They were also a more performant solution. A simple example may be seen below:

```js
import React from 'react';

const Counter = (props) => {
  const incrementCount = () => {
    // invoke a function that alters the state on the parent component providing the "count" prop
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {props.count} <button onClick={incrementCount} /></p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The drawback of functional components (as seen in the example above) is that all of their data has to come from props, and thus at some point
they have to be wrapped in a parent class-based component in order to manage the component state at a higher level.

Now if only there was a way to add state directly to a functional component, we could remove the need for class-based components entirely...
